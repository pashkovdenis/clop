CLOPE: a fast and effective clustering algorithm for transactional data


This paper studies the problem of categorical data clustering,
especially for transactional data characterized by high
dimensionality and large volume. Starting from a heuristic method
of increasing the height-to-width ratio of the cluster histogram, we
develop a novel algorithm â€“ CLOPE, which is very fast and
scalable, while being quite effective. We demonstrate the
performance of our algorithm on two real world datasets, and
compare CLOPE with the state-of-art algorithms.
